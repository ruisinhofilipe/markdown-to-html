    <h4>You can always count on me when ...</h4>

    <p>
      As a group and in order to the group succed, everyone needs to work and do
      their part of the job and that's exactly what you can expect from me. I
      also like to help the others, whenever I can be useful. My french level is
      average, not bad but far from being good, so I'm sure you'll have a great
      hearing me trying to speak french which is always a plus.

    <h4>Funny story</h4>

    <p>
      So, have you heard about the mobile game called PokemonGO, right ? In case
      you haven't it's because you've probably been living in a cave for the
      past decade or so... Basically you use your phone to play Pokemon in real
      life, the game(PokemonGO) kinda simulates the anime and you can capture
      pokemons, fight against others people and so one. A few years ago I was
      playing it with some friends outside and we were really excited because a
      legendary Pokemon had come out that day and we wanted to capture it. To
      capture it we have to group up with other people and fight that new
      legendary pokemon in a RAID, this RAIDS are spawned in certain locations
      around your city/country whatever and thus if you want to fight in those
      RAIDS you need to be located closed to one. So, there we were, walking
      around one of those RAIDS location trying to find more people to do the
      raids with. (For context, let's call the Legendary pokemon by WER.) After
      a few minutes of walking around searching, we saw a couple near one of the
      locations, they were clearly older than us, probably 30-40s. We aproached
      the couple and asked "Hey! are you here for WER(the legendary pokemon)?
      Turns out they were undercover cops and by "WER" they assumed we were
      trying to sell them / buy drugs from them... we tried to explain that
      everything was a missunderstanding and in reallity we were just "capturing
      pokemons". They ended by searching for something in ours backpacks and
      check our IDs but eventually they let us go.
    </p>

    <h6>TL;DR:</h6>
    <p>
      Asked a couple of undercover cops if they were also trying to capture a
      legendary Pokemon in PokemonGo and they tought I was trying to sell / buy
      drugs.
